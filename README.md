# HelloWorld
My Hello World project we did in class monday, with a little extra added.
After when we added the READKEY function, it made me wonder how I could go about requiring a specific key to be pressed.
So I did some digging online and learned about a While function, which let the program know when the E key was pressed, hece closing the pogram.
